        In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf.

        One Sunday morning the warm sun came up and - pop! - out of the egg
        came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar.

        ( drawing of the sun :D )

        He started to look for some food.

        On Monday he ate through one apple. But he was still hungry.

        That night he had a stomachache!

        ( drawing of a leaf ~~ )

        The next day was Sunday again. The caterpillar ate through one nice
        green leaf, and after that he felt much better.

        Now he wasn't hungry any more - and he wasn't a little caterpillar any
        more. He was a big fat caterpillar :<

        He built a small house, called a cocoon, around himself. He stayed
        inside for more than two weeks. Then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon,
        pushed his way out and ...

        he was a beautiful butterfly!
